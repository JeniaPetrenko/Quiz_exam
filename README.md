# Quiz_exam

You have been given the task of creating a quiz application for NAkademin. Users must be able to answer questions and receive feedback on whether they have answered them correctly or incorrectly. The application should work without any major bugs. You choose which questions the quiz will consist of.
You must also have your project on Github and push up code continuously during the course of the project

The quiz contains 10 questions. The questions consist of true/false statements with two possible answer options: True or False.

In addition to answering questions for the quiz, the user must also be able to change the appearance of the page between dark mode (ie dark background color with light text) and light mode (light background color with dark text).

The user must be able to answer all questions and then click a button to see their result.

Print the number of rights that the user received. Also use color and text to communicate the user's results based on the following criteria:

< 50% - Fail (red)

50%-75% - Good (yellow/orange)

> 75% - Really good job (green)

You have made at least 8 commits to your Github repository during the course of the project.

All G requirements are met

The questions must consist of a mixture of the following types (at least 2 of each type)

True/False statements - (Two answer options - True or False)

Multiple choice - (Four answer options, one of which is correct)

Checkbox answers (4 checkboxes with answer options - 2 or 3 correct answers, others incorrect).

The user must be able to see exactly which questions he answered correctly and/or incorrectly when the result is displayed. (If he answered the question incorrectly, you decide for yourself whether you want to print the correct answer or not).

Technical requirement: The code follows the "DRY" principle (Dont repeat yourself), avoids major repetitions of code in the logic.

Bonus: Try styling the quiz with CSS to make it look a little more user-friendly!
